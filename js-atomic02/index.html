  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  
  <p>Is used when you want to alert the user of a issue or sent out a message to the user.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  
  <p>If they forget a input for a form that is important. Mostly to warning message to the users.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  
  <p>If you have it come up on missing input and not the whole form together. To pop up every time you load a page or use multiple ones on one page</p>
  
  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  
  <p>I don't think the user really needs it since it is used for debugging. It is a way to "print out"" to the console. For the coder to see what the computer is processing."</p>
  
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>

<p>It is after the first alert() when the user clicks okay to close the dialog box. I found out by reloading the page and watching the console. Though if you look at the code it is after the alert box code.</p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>

<p>Is there a point to use alert boxes if there now a days softer alert messages.</p>
