  <p>true and false part where true == 'true' was wrong. I was kinda surprise and then I remember no '' so it wouldn't equal to each other</p>
  
  <h2>What do you call true and false values</h2>
  <p>Boolean value</p>
  <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
  <p>Well "true" is converted to NaN and true is converted to 1. Not really</p>
