  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>Not really code wise, but reading wise yes. It can be confusing if you have it out of order</p>
  
  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p>I used && because the person is 15 below and can't go below 0 since there is info for 0</p>
  
  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p>Well it is an error value. It's short for not a number and it is a number value. Yes it is important to check for NaN values. Hmmm maybe not. Hmmm maybe because it is part of boolean.</p>
