  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>Yes it has to work with a pattern for it.</p>
  
  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>It means to different things which a age number can not be blow 16 and above 21 it makes to sense</p>
  
  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>Set up a location where users could pick which country and look it up at country.</p>
