  <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
  <p>== works better with secret number because it looks over it being a string. Though if you really want exact you should use parseInt() and ===</p>
  
  <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
  <p>Well in that case === would be better because it is already as a integer. </p>
  
  <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
  <p>Where === is a strict equality operator only consider value equal that have the same type. Lenient equality operator for == tries to convert values of different types before comparing like strict equality.</p>
  
  <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
  <p>Hmmm For me I said === with parseInt because it is exact and no room for errors where the other there are chances that errors could happen.</p>
