  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>At the moment yes since I didn't have a way to lower or uppercase the input</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>yes well sorta. I used a != and === if correct was false. Because I was wanting if the password false to show the message where if true it goes on. Well looking it up where === is a strict equality operator only consider value equal that have the same type. Lenient equality operator for == tries to convert values of different types before comparing like strict equality.</p>
  
  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>Because anyone can look it up with the developer on the browser</p>
