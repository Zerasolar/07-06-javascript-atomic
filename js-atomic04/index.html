  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>Comes in as strings. No it turns into a string.</p>
    
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>Empty strings for any that clicks okay.</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>Hmm I did your, but I think if I was building something I would do user instead of your to make better sense of what I want the code to do.</p>
  
  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>Yes you need to rename it if you change what the answer will be. If you had what is your favorite character name is? You wouldn't want username for the variable. If you change the order of question and not take the set variable with it then yes too.</p>
  
  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Well sometimes you use forms for it and can collect a lot of information. Well back in the 90's you could personalize a site with a user prompt of their name.</p>
  
  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>No there really isn't a way to have two fields. It's only one field per window</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>none so far now</p>
