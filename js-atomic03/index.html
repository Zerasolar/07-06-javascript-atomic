  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>To set strings or integers. Later on you change change them without doing var "variable name". You only need "variable name"</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>advantages is to know what you are setting. It'll be easier to read it if you come back to it several months later. Disadvantage is well if you have a lot of variables you may find var statements to get a bit unreadable I guess</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>Well from treehouse we can change the variable without doing var "name" we can do "name"</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
