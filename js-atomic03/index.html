  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>To set strings or integers. Later on you change change them without doing var "variable name". You only need "variable name"</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>advantages is to know what you are setting. It'll be easier to read it if you come back to it several months later. Disadvantage is well if you have a lot of variables you may find var statements to get a bit unreadable I guess</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>Well from treehouse we can change the variable without doing var "name" we can do "name". Since it is similar to ruby for variables maybe it'll do some of the same things</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>Well I think it is setting that word to be a variable and that you can call on it again and again. Though you can use var again if you want to set it.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>If you do "" it'll be an empty string, but you can't set an empty integer. Yes with string, no with integer. With integer it got a syntaxerror: expected expression, got ';'</p>
  
  <h2>What question do you have?</h2>
  <p>errr none so far here</p>
