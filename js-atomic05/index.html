  <p>Look at Console.log</p>
  
  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
<p>It goes NaN if it starts with letters. If it starts with numbers then yes it works. It needs integer numbers, but it can work with floats too.</p>

<h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
<p>Takes them in, but I believe they go with the nearest 0 for the floats and just take out the comma for the other number.</p>

<h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
<p>If you are doing a game or a score or anything that only goes up one at a time. Maybe counting users, or scores for games.</p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Learn about the compound assignment operators (like += and -=) -- what problem do these solve and how are they used? What are situations where you might use a compound assignment operator instead of simple assignment (with =)? Which is easier to read: x += 2; or x = x + 2;?</h2>
<p>They add the number to itself and shows the results. For example +=10 = 20. They could be use for scores or doubling a results for an application. Hmmm not totally sure on if there is anything else. For me x = x + 2.</p>

<h2>Research the Javascript Math Object -- can you get some of these methods to work? I'll recommend Math.pow(), Math.max(), and Math.abs() as starting points.</h2>
